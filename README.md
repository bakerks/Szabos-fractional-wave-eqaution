Code used to generate the results given in 'Baker &amp; Banjai 2020: Numerical analysis of a wave equation for lossy media obeying a frequency power law' 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04520)

All 1D experiments are done using matlab, the core code and support files (fem functions) have been uploaded. We also make use of a gauss jacobi quadrature code by Toby Driscoll.

In 2D experiments are done using python in order to make use of Netgen/NGsolve for meshing and finite element objects (https://ngsolve.org/)
